## Advanced Merging Methods

### Rearranging with Rebase (rewriting history)
- Rebase is an advanced feature.
- There are many strong opinions about whether or not to use rebase, so check your team guidelines about using rebase. 
- There is a Pluralsight course "Rewriting Git History" that does a deep dive on rebase.
- Rebase use cases:
  - Clean up local history before sharing a branch
  - Pull changes from a branch into your branch without performing a merge
  - You can use rebase to squash multiple commits
  - Do **NOT** use rebase on a public branch
